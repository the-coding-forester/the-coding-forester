### ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Stephanie

I am an Associate Software Engineer in Cloud at Kaplan. 

While I am still learning AWS and serverless, I am a full-stack engineer proficient in Javascript, HTML, CSS and complimentary tools and libraries. I have a B.S in Forest Resource Conservation and completed a full-stack immersive bootcamp as a part of my transition from forestry to software engineering. In both my roles as a forester and as a developer I have worked with complex systems that had to be broken down into smaller parts to solve problems and make improvement. 

In addition to my techincal skills and complex system experience, I also have over a decade of leadership and training experiences at various companies and in different environments including retail, education, natural resources, and now software engineering.
